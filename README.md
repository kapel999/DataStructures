# DataStructures
A program which will solve a railway transport network problem. 

Part one of the project provides an undirected graph which represent rail transport network. The graph verticies represent the stations and edges represent the direct rail links between them.

Part two of the project involved adding new methods such as breadth-first traversal or finding the shortest route between two stations.
